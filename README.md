# Blank Website

This project is a simple blank website to allow quick set up of a website while learning HTML CSS and Javascript. It has 3 files index.html, style.css and script.js. These files are already linked together. Just download the project then open `index.html` in a browser.

This file is just for information you do not need it as part of the website so can delete it when you download the project.
